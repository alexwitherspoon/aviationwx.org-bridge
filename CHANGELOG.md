# Changelog

All notable changes to AviationWX.org Bridge will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Web UI**: Webcam preview no longer flashes every second; only updates when a new capture exists (last_capture_time changed)
- **Web UI**: Status text (countdown, badges) updates in place without rebuilding preview images
- **Boot-update**: Use `/releases?per_page=1` instead of `/releases/latest` (avoids 404 for repo names with dots)
- **Boot-update**: Use jq for release metadata parsing (tag_name, prerelease, published_at, min_host_version)

### Added
- **Install**: Add `install_jq` so jq is available for boot-update and recovery scripts
- **Tests**: Preview API endpoint (Go) and shouldRefreshPreview logic (JS)

## [2.5.0] - 2026-02-20

### Changed
- **GHCR image path**: `ghcr.io/alexwitherspoon/aviationwx.org-bridge` → `ghcr.io/alexwitherspoon/aviationwx-org-bridge`
  - Hyphen naming everywhere we control (container, binaries, image). Period only for GitHub URLs.
  - Migration required: update `docker pull` and scripts to use new path.

### Fixed
- **Boot-update**: Add `min_host_version` to release metadata (fixes "No min_host_version" on fresh install)
- **Boot-update**: Fallback to `/releases` list when `/releases/latest` 404s (GitHub API issue with dots in repo names)
- **Boot-update**: Use lowercase repo path for GitHub API
- **Boot-update**: Fallback tag parsing from `name` field when `jq` extraction fails
- **Install banner**: Fix alignment of https://aviationwx.org line
- **Install bootstrap**: Run container-start after boot-update so container actually starts (boot-update only updates version)

## [2.4.1] - 2026-02-20

### Changed
- **Display name consistency**: "AviationWX Bridge" → "AviationWX.org Bridge" across release titles, docs, web UI, and scripts
- **Supervisor**: Use `grep -F` for literal image name match (avoids regex `.` matching any char)
- **ASCII banners**: Fix spacing/alignment in Makefile, install.sh, test-ci-local.sh, aviationwx-recovery.sh

## [2.4.0] - 2026-02-20

### Changed
- **Repository rename**: `aviationwx-bridge` → `AviationWX.org-Bridge`
  - GitHub URL: `github.com/alexwitherspoon/AviationWX.org-Bridge`
  - Docker image: `ghcr.io/alexwitherspoon/aviationwx-org-bridge`
  - Container name: `aviationwx-org-bridge`
  - Binary artifacts: `aviationwx-org-bridge-{arch}`

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **Test Snapshot UI**: Test camera configuration before saving
  - "Test Snapshot" button in Add/Edit Camera modal
  - Live preview of captured image; validates HTTP/RTSP/ONVIF config
  - Extracted `form-utils.js` with `buildCameraConfigFromFormValues` for testability
  - Node built-in test runner for frontend form logic
- **SFTP Mutex**: Serialize Upload and TestConnection per SFTPClient to prevent race conditions
- **Scheduler Panic Recovery**: Wrap upload worker in defer/recover; log panic and stack, treat as failure
- **Watchdog Bridge Check**: Script checks bridge process and web console before restarting services
- **GitHub Copilot Instructions**: Repository-wide `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for Copilot context

### Fixed
- Concurrent SFTP uploads could race; mutex ensures safe reuse of client

### Testing
- `TestHandleTestCamera` and `TestHandleTestUpload` for web API
- `TestBridge_testCamera` unit tests (success, capture error, create error)
- Integration test: `POST /api/test/camera` with TestCamera mock
- Frontend: 12 unit tests for `buildCameraConfigFromFormValues`
