# GitHub Release Template

This document defines the format for GitHub releases and the machine-readable metadata used by the auto-update system.

## Release Format

Each release should follow this structure:

```markdown
## What's Changed

- Feature: Brief description
- Fix: Brief description
- Breaking: Major change description (if any)

## AVIATIONWX_METADATA

```json
{
  "min_host_version": "2.0",
  "deprecates": ["v1.0.0", "v1.1.0"],
  "edge_stable_commit": "abc123def456"
}
```

## Full Changelog

```

## Metadata Fields

### `min_host_version` (required)

The minimum host script version required to run this release. If the host scripts are older than this version, they will be automatically updated before the container update proceeds.

**Example:**
```json
"min_host_version": "2.0"
```

**Usage:**
- Set to `"2.0"` for all releases requiring the new watchdog/supervisor architecture
- Bump only when host scripts have breaking changes or critical new features
- Format: Semantic version string without 'v' prefix

### `deprecates` (optional)

Array of version tags that are explicitly deprecated and should trigger an update.

**Example:**
```json
"deprecates": ["v1.0.0", "v1.1.0", "v1.2.0"]
```

**Usage:**
- Include versions with critical security issues
- Include versions with data corruption bugs
- Include versions incompatible with current API/services
- Format: Full tag names including 'v' prefix

### `edge_stable_commit` (optional, edge releases only)

For edge releases, the git commit hash that passed stability testing.

**Example:**
```json
"edge_stable_commit": "abc123def456789"
```

**Usage:**
- Set on edge pre-releases after 24h of successful testing
- Allows edge failback logic to determine if an edge release is stable enough
- If missing or mismatched, edge channel will failback to latest

## Release Checklist

- [ ] Release notes include `AVIATIONWX_METADATA` block
- [ ] `min_host_version` set correctly
- [ ] `deprecates` includes any versions with known critical issues
- [ ] For edge releases: add `edge_stable_commit` after stability verification
- [ ] Docker image is built and published automatically by CI
- [ ] Test installation on clean Pi Zero 2 W (if major release)

### Edge Release (After Stability Verification)

```markdown

```

## Notes

- The `AVIATIONWX_METADATA` block must be valid JSON
- The metadata is parsed by `aviationwx-supervisor.sh` using `grep` and basic parsing
- Keep metadata simple - complex logic should be in the host scripts, not the metadata
- Edge releases should be marked as "pre-release" in GitHub
- Stable releases should NOT be marked as "pre-release"
